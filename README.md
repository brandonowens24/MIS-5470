# MIS-5470
A repo that includes smaller coursework items from my MIS 5470 Practical Computing for Data Analytics Course.

## Course Description
The overlapping fields of business analytics and data science are getting all kinds of attention in the business world. While trusty tools like Excel spreadsheets and SQL databases are still widely used, there are many other, more programmatic, tools wielded by analysts. In this class you will begin to learn how to use R and Python (along with a myriad of other computational tools) to do business analytics work such as:
* Find, gather, clean and prepare data for analysis and modeling,
* Do exploratory data analysis as a prelude to model building,
* Build predictive and/or descriptive models using appropriate modeling techniques ,
* Assess model performance and compare competing models,
* Communicate results using appropriate data summaries and visualizations,
* Create well documented and reproducible analytical workflows.
